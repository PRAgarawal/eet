### Summary 
This is a slack bot that is meant to gather volunteers for people who would like to get lunch with a group of people within their organization. After collecting volunteers, it will randomly split them up into reasonably sized groups. The idea is to facilitate team building among people who may not otherwise talk or work with each other much in the day to day.
